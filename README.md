# project-1 – Basic Python Calculator 🧮

This is a simple calculator script written in Python. It takes user input and performs the four basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

It's a beginner-level project created during my first week of learning to program. While simple, it's meaningful to me as my first step into writing and understanding code.

# 💡 Purpose

I'm using GitHub as my personal development log whdocumenting every project I build, no matter how small. The goal is to track my progress and show consistent growth over time.

**project-1** is the first entry in that journey.


# ⚙️ How It Works

- Prompts the user to input two numbers
- Performs all four arithmetic operations (no conditional logic)
- Displays the results clearly in the terminal

> This version runs all operations by default and doesn't include menus or branching (`if/else`) — keeping things minimal and focused on fundamentals.

# 📘 What I Learned

- Taking and converting user input in Python
- Performing arithmetic operations
- Structuring a small script
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

# 🚀 What's Next

As I continue learning, I’ll be adding more projects, gradually increasing in complexity. Each repository on my GitHub will serve as a timestamp in my learning process.

Thanks for taking a look!
